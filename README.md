##1.1 Programming (General)
A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time. Basic instruction types are:
- Input: A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.
- Process: A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.
- Output: A program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, network, etc.

Programs use variables to refer to data, like x, y, and z below. The name is due to a variable's value varying as a program assigns a variable like x with new values.

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int wage;

  wage = 20;

  cout << "Salary is ";
  cout << wage * 40 * 52;
  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
