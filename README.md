# UOP_COMP051
## 1.1 Programming (General)
A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time. Basic instruction types are:
- Input: A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.
- Process: A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.
- Output: A program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, network, etc.

Programs use variables to refer to data, like x, y, and z below. The name is due to a variable's value varying as a program assigns a variable like x with new values.

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() { // A program begins executing statements in main(). 
  int wage; // 'int wage' declares an integer variable. 'wage = 20' assigns wage with 20.

  wage = 20;

  cout << "Salary is "; // The cout statement outputs 'Salary is ' to the screen at the cursor's present location.
  cout << wage * 40 * 52; // outputs the result of wage * 40 * 52, so 20 * 40 * 52 or 41600.
  cout << endl; // 'endl' moves the output cursor to the next line on the screen.

  return 0; // The 'return 0' statement ends the program.
}
```

## 1.2 Programming Basics
### Basic input
The following statement gets an input value and puts that value into variable x: cin >> x; cin is short for characters in.

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
   int wage;
   
   cin >> wage; // gets an input value from the keyboard (or file, etc.) and puts that value into the wage variable.
 
   cout << "Salary is ";
   cout << wage * 40 * 52;
   cout << endl;
 
   return 0;
}
```
### Basic ouput
The cout construct supports output; cout is short for characters out.
Outputting text is achieved via: cout << "desired text";.
Text in double quotes " " is known as a string literal.
Multiple cout statements continue printing on the same output line.
The statement cout << endl; starts a new output line, called a newline.

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
   cout << "This is the first paragraph.";
   cout << endl;
   cout << "The cursor has been moved to the next line."
   cout << endl;
   cout << endl;
   cout << "This is the second paragraph.";

   return 0;
}
/*
This is the first paragraph.
The cursor has been moved to the next line.

This is the second paragraph
*/
```

Outputting a variable's value is achieved via: cout << x;. Note that no quotes surround x.
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int wage;
   
   wage = 20;

   cout << "Wage is: ";
   cout << wage; 
   cout << endl;
   cout << "Goodbye.";
   cout << endl;

   return 0;
}
/*
Wage is: 20
Goodbye.
*/
```
Programmers commonly use a single output statement for each line of output by combining the outputting of text, variable values, and a new line. The programmer simply separates the items with << symbols. Such combining can improve program readability because the program's code corresponds more closely to the program's output.
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int wage;

   wage = 20;

   cout << "Wage is: " << wage << endl; 
   cout << "Goodbye." << endl;

   return 0;
}
```
## 1.3 Comments and Whitespace
### Comments 
A comment is text a programmer adds to code, to be read by humans to better understand the code but ignored by the compiler. Two common kinds of comments exist:
- A single-line comment starts with // and includes all the following text on that line. Single-line comments commonly appear after a statement on the same line.
- A multi-line comment starts with /* and ends with */, where all text between /* and */ is part of the comment. A multi-line comment is also known as a block comment.

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
/*
 This program calculates the amount of pasta to cook, given the
 number of people eating.
*/
int main ()
{
   int numPeople;         // Number of people that will be eating
   int totalOuncesPasta;  // Total ounces of pasta to serve numPeople
   
   // Get number of people
   cout << "Enter number of people: " << endl;
   cin  >> numPeople;
   
   // Calculate and print total ounces of pasta
   totalOuncesPasta = numPeople * 3;  // Typical ounces per person
   cout << "Cook " << totalOuncesPasta << " ounces of pasta." << endl;
   
   return 0;
}
```
### Whitespace
Whitespace refers to blank spaces (space and tab characters) between items within a statement and blank lines between statements (called newlines). A compiler ignores most whitespace (Not all spaces are ignored by the compiler. Ex: The spaces in a string literal like "Enter age: " will be printed if the string is output).

- Use blank lines to separate conceptually distinct statements.
- Indent lines the same amount.
- Align items to reduce visual clutter.
- Use a single space before and after any operators like =, +, *, or << to make statements more readable.

```C
//good use of whitespace
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int myFirstVar;    // Aligned comments yield less
   int yetAnotherVar; // visual clutter 
   int thirdVar; 
  
   // Above blank line separates variable declarations from the rest
   cout << "Enter a number: ";
   cin  >> myFirstVar;
  
   // Above blank line separates user input statements from the rest   
   yetAnotherVar = myFirstVar;        // Aligned = operators
   thirdVar      = yetAnotherVar + 1; 
   // Also notice the single-space on left and right of + and =
   // (except when aligning the second = with the first =)

   cout << "Final value is " << thirdVar << endl; // Single-space on each side of <<
  
   return 0; // The above blank line separates the return from the rest
}
```
The compiler converts a high-level program into an executable program using machine code (0s and 1s).
Comments do not generate machine code.
The compiler recognizes end of statement by semicolon ";".

## 1.4 Errors and Warning
### Syntax error
People make mistakes. Programmers thus make mistakes—lots of them. One kind of mistake, known as a syntax error, is to violate a programming language's rules on how symbols can be combined to create a program. An example is forgetting to end a statement with a semicolon.
![](./syntaxError.png)

Example: 
```C
cout << numCats. (statement ending with semicolon, not period)
cout << "Cats: " numCats; (iterms must be seperated by "<<")
cout < numCats; ("<<" is required, not "<")
cout << "Cats: << numCats; (missing the ending ")
cout << NumCats; (the declare variable is "numCats")
cout >> numCats; (must use "<<" instead of ">>" for cout)
```

### Unclear error message
Compiler error messages are often unclear or even misleading. The message is like the compiler's "best guess" of what is really wrong.
![](./unclearError.png)
The compiler indicates a missing semicolon ';'. But the real error is the missing << symbols.
Sometimes the compiler error message refers to a line that is actually many lines past where the error actually occurred. Not finding an error at the specified line, the programmer should look to previous lines.
For example: When a compiler says that an error exists on line 5, the error may actually exist in an earlier line, but the compiler didn't get confused until reaching line 5.

The actual error could be different, like missing parentheses. If a programmer makes a mistake, the statement and subsequent statements may still be valid code, but eventually the compiler cannot make sense of the code and generates an error message.
Some errors create an upsettingly long list of error messages. Good practice is to focus on fixing just the first error reported by the compiler and then recompiling. The remaining error messages may be real but are more commonly due to the compiler's confusion caused by the first error and are thus irrelevant.

### Logic error
Because a syntax error is detected by the compiler, a syntax error is known as a type of compile-time error.
Successfully compiling means the program doesn't have compile-time errors, but the program may have other kinds of errors. A logic error, also called a bug, is an error that occurs while a program runs. For example, a programmer might mean to type numBeans * numJars but accidentally types numBeans + numJars (+ instead of *). The program would compile but would not run as intended.

### Compiler warning
A compiler will sometimes report a warning, which doesn't stop the compiler from creating an executable program but indicates a possible logic error. Ex: Some compilers will report a warning like "Warning, dividing by 0 is not defined" if encountering code like: totalItems = numItems / 0 (running that program does result in a runtime error).
