## 1.1 Programming (General)
A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time. Basic instruction types are:
- Input: A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.
- Process: A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.
- Output: A program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, network, etc.

Programs use variables to refer to data, like x, y, and z below. The name is due to a variable's value varying as a program assigns a variable like x with new values.

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() { // A program begins executing statements in main(). 
  int wage; // 'int wage' declares an integer variable. 'wage = 20' assigns wage with 20.

  wage = 20;

  cout << "Salary is "; // The cout statement outputs 'Salary is ' to the screen at the cursor's present location.
  cout << wage * 40 * 52; // outputs the result of wage * 40 * 52, so 20 * 40 * 52 or 41600.
  cout << endl; // 'endl' moves the output cursor to the next line on the screen.

  return 0; // The 'return 0' statement ends the program.
}
```

### Basic input
The following statement gets an input value and puts that value into variable x: cin >> x; cin is short for characters in.

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
   int wage;
   
   cin >> wage; // gets an input value from the keyboard (or file, etc.) and puts that value into the wage variable.
 
   cout << "Salary is ";
   cout << wage * 40 * 52;
   cout << endl;
 
   return 0;
}
```
### Basic ouput
The cout construct supports output; cout is short for characters out.
Outputting text is achieved via: cout << "desired text";.
Text in double quotes " " is known as a string literal.
Multiple cout statements continue printing on the same output line.
The statement cout << endl; starts a new output line, called a newline.

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
   cout << "This is the first paragraph.";
   cout << endl;
   cout << "The cursor has been moved to the next line."
   cout << endl;
   cout << endl;
   cout << "This is the second paragraph.";

   return 0;
}
/*
This is the first paragraph.
The cursor has been moved to the next line.

This is the second paragraph
*/
```
Outputting a variable's value is achieved via: cout << x;. Note that no quotes surround x.
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int wage;
   
   wage = 20;

   cout << "Wage is: ";
   cout << wage; 
   cout << endl;
   cout << "Goodbye.";
   cout << endl;

   return 0;
}
/*
Wage is: 20
Goodbye.
*/
```
Programmers commonly use a single output statement for each line of output by combining the outputting of text, variable values, and a new line. The programmer simply separates the items with << symbols. Such combining can improve program readability because the program's code corresponds more closely to the program's output.
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int wage;

   wage = 20;

   cout << "Wage is: " << wage << endl; 
   cout << "Goodbye." << endl;

   return 0;
}
```
